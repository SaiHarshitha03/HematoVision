What is HematoVision?


Itâ€™s a computer program designed to automatically identify and classify different types of blood cells from images. Instead of a human expert looking at blood samples under a microscope, HematoVision uses advanced AI techniques to do it faster and just as accurately.

How does it work?


The program uses something called *transfer learning*. This means it starts with a model that already understands general patterns in images (learned from a lot of pictures) and then fine-tunes it specifically to recognize blood cells. It uses a large set of 12,000 labeled blood cell images (like eosinophils, lymphocytes, etc.) to learn how to tell them apart.

Why is this useful?


* It helps doctors and lab technicians by quickly analyzing blood samples with high accuracy.
* It saves time and effort, reducing the need for manual work.
* It can be used in hospitals, remote health services, or for training medical students.

Examples of how HematoVision can be used:

1. In Hospitals: Automate blood tests to speed up diagnosis and improve accuracy, helping doctors make faster decisions.
2. Remote Healthcare: Doctors can analyze blood samples from faraway places without patients needing to travel, using uploaded images.
3. Medical Training: Students can practice identifying blood cells using the system, getting instant feedback to learn better.
